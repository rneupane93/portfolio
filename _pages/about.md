<h2> about me... </h2>
I’m a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Missouri, currently in my 4th year, and a Cyberinfrastructure Engineer at the Center for Cyber Education, Resaerch and Infrastructure (CERI) within University of Missouri College of Engineering. I'm a passionate researcher fascinated by the intersection of cybersecurity, cloud computing, and AI. I enjoy solving complex problems, leading innovative projects, and collaborating with brilliant minds to bring bold ideas to life.

Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working on projects that range from securing cloud platforms against modern cyber threats to building intelligent blockchain solutions for smart grids and insurance claims. Along the way, I’ve published papers in top-tier conferences and journals, exploring everything from active cyber defense to IoT security. Each project has been an opportunity to combine cutting-edge technology with practical, real-world applications.

Beyond the technical work, I find immense satisfaction in mentoring students and guiding teams through exciting R&D challenges. Seeing others grow and achieve their goals—whether it’s publishing a paper or tackling a complex research problem—is one of the most rewarding aspects of my journey.

When I’m not immersed in research, you’ll often find me exploring my creative side—whether it’s strumming my guitar to unwind, getting lost in a good computer game, or brainstorming new ideas for innovative applications. Balancing these interests keeps me refreshed and brings a touch of creativity to everything I do.
